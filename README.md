IPython-based Configuration System
==================================

OpenMM command line app config file framework / parser based on IPython traitlets
system.

Features
--------

1. Units
  ```
  $ openmm --dt=1
  [OpenMM] WARNING | No config file was found.
  [OpenMM] ERROR | The 'dt' trait of the dynamics section must have units of
  femtosecond, but a value without units, 1, was specified. To specify units,
  use a syntax like --dt=2*femtosecond on the command line, or c.Dynamics.dt =
  2*femtosecond in the config file.
  ```

2. Did you mean?
  ```
  $ openmm --collision_ratee=1/picoseconds
  [OpenMM] WARNING | No config file was found.
  [OpenMM] ERROR | Unrecognized option: 'collision_ratee'. Did you mean
  'collision_rate'?
  ```

3. Ensuring that supplied configuration options actually make sense
  ```
  $ openmm --temp=300*kelvin --integrator=Verlet
  [OpenMM] WARNING | No config file was found.
  [OpenMM] ERROR | The temperature target option, 'temp', is only appropriate when
  using a thermostat or stochastic integrator.

  $ openmm --barostat=None  --pressure=1*atmosphere
  [OpenMM] WARNING | No config file was found.
  [OpenMM] ERROR | The pressure target option, 'pressure', is only appropriate
  when using the Monte Carlo barostat.
